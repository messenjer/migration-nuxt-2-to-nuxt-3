# Nuxt-2 to Nuxt-3 migration Workshop

Welcome to the Nuxt 3 Migration Workshop! This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of transitioning a
Nuxt 2 application to Nuxt 3. Through a series of exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience and deepen your
understanding of the Nuxt 3 migration strategy.

## Structure

In this workshop, we have organized our project into three distinct folders to guide you through the migration process:

1. **nuxt-2**: This directory contains the original application built with Nuxt 2. It serves as our production
   application, showing the application in its initial state before any migration efforts. You should not make any
   modifications in this folder.

2. **nuxt-3**: Inside this folder, you'll find the application that has been successfully migrated to Nuxt 3. It
   represents the end goal of our migration journey, offering a reference point for how the app should look and function
   after the migration process. You should not make any modifications in this folder.

3. **nuxt-3-starting**: This is a special directory set up for the hands-on exercises in this workshop. It provides a
   starting point for you to practice the migration steps. While it's based on the Nuxt 3 structure, some components or
   features might be missing or incomplete, and your task will be to fill in the gaps as part of the exercises. You have
   an exercises folder with the instructions of each exercise. The solution folder contain the files solutions for each
   exercise. You need the copy the content of each solution to have the final one

By working through these directories, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the migration process, from where you
start to where you aim to finish, with practical exercises to reinforce your learning."
